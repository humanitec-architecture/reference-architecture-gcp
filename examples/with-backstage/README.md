# GCP reference architecture with Backstage

Provisions the GCP reference architecture connected to Humanitec and installs Backstage.

## Prerequisites

* The same prerequisites as the [base reference architecture](../../README.md#prerequisites), plus the following items.
* A GitHub organization and permission to create new repositories in it. Go to https://github.com/account/organizations/new to create a new org (the "Free" option is fine). Note: is has to be an organization, a free account is not sufficient.
* Create a classic github personal access token with `repo`, `workflow`, `delete_repo` and `admin:org` scope [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
* Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to your token.
  ```
  export GITHUB_TOKEN="my-github-token"
  ```
* Set the `GITHUB_ORG_ID` environment variable to your GitHub organization ID.
  ```
  export GITHUB_ORG_ID="my-github-org-id"
  ```
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed locally.
* Install the GitHub App for Backstage into your GitHub organization using `node create-gh-app/index.js`. Follow the instructions.
  * “All repositories” ~> Install
  * “Okay, […] was installed on the […] account.” ~> You can close the window and server.

## Usage

Follow the same steps as for the [base layer](../../README.md#usage), applying these modifications:
* Execute `cd ./examples/with-backstage` after cloning the repo. Execute all subsequent commands in this directory.
* In particular, use the `./examples/with-backstage/terraform.tfvars.example` file as the basis for your `terraform.tfvars` file. It defines additional variables needed to setup and configure Backstage.

## Verify your result

Check for the existence of key elements of the backstage module. This is a subset of all elements only. For a complete list of what was installed, review the Terraform code.

1. Perform the [verification steps of the base installation](../../README.md) if you have not already done so.
2. Verify the existence of the Backstage Application in your Humanitec Organization:
   ```
   curl -s https://api.humanitec.io/orgs/${HUMANITEC_ORG}/apps/backstage \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer ${HUMANITEC_TOKEN}"
   ```
   This should output a JSON formatted representation of the Application like so:
   ```
   {"id":"backstage","name":"backstage","created_at":"2023-10-02T13:44:27Z","created_by":"s-d3e94a0e-8b53-29f9-b666-27548b7e06e0","envs":[{"id":"development","name":"Development","type":"development"}]}
   ```
   You can also check for the Application in the [Humanitec Platform Orchestrator UI](https://app.humanitec.io).

3. Connect to your GKE cluster via `kubectl`. See the [GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl) or use this command:
   ```
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials htc-ref-arch-cluster --location <my-gcp-region>
   ```
4. Get the elements in the newly created Kubernetes namespace:
   ```
   kubectl get all -n backstage-development
   ```
   You should see
   - a `deployment`, `replicaset`, running `pod`, and `service` for Backstage
   - a `statefulset`, running `pod`, and `service` for PostgreSQL database used by Backstage.

   Note: it may take up to ten minutes after the `terraform apply` completed until you actually see those resources. The Backstage application needs to built and deployed via a GitHub action out of the newly created repository in your GitHub organization.


## Cleaning up

Once you are finished with the reference architecture, you can remove all provisioned infrastructure and the resource definitions created in Humanitec with the following:

1. Delete all Humanitec applications scaffolded using Backstage, but not the `backstage` app itself.

2. Follow the [base reference architecture cleanup instructions](../../README.md#cleaning-up).
